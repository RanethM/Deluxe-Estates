The newly built mansion perfectly combines English architecture and cutting-edge design. Every inch of the property, from its soaring ceilings and marble floors to the hand-finished cabinetry and bespoke detailing, has been thoroughly considered. \n Unfolding across two floors, the house has been designed with a sense of volume, light and flow. The entrance sets the tone with its palatial proportions, a marble staircase and coffered ceilings. From here, a sequence of reception rooms unfurls, formal drawing and dining rooms, a fully fitted study, a cinema room, and a vast kitchen and family room that serves as the heart of the home.",

Temple, director of the Shaw Savill shipping company, who worked closely with his cousin, architect Norman Shaw, to build an imposing country house, known as Leyswood House. The property had a succession of owners following the death of James Temple and his widow in 1919, and was later occupied by the Canadian Army. Following the Second World War, a large area of Leyswood House went into disrepair and was later demolished. It is rumoured that the bricks were used to build further ancillary properties around the estate, including Little Leyswood, around the 1950s.<br>Little Leyswood is a much-loved, light and spacious four-bedroom bungalow in good order, whilst offering a wonderful opportunity for a new owner to put their stamp on the property moving forward.",
